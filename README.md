## üé® Design Philosophy

### Color Analysis
The refined color palette was carefully extracted from your business card:

**Deep Hunter Green (#0A3428)**
- The exact rich, dark green from your card
- Creates depth, trust, and sophistication
- Darker than typical "forest green" - more luxurious

**Warm Gold (#D4A574)**
- The warm, classic gold from your text
- Less yellow than "bright" gold
- More champagne-like but warmer
- Conveys quality and prestige

**Why These Colors Work:**
- Deep green: Trust, stability, growth, premium service
- Warm gold: Luxury, success, quality, elegance
- Together: Professional yet approachable, trustworthy yet premium

This palette perfectly captures the sophisticated, high-quality nature of Gyce Signature Service - elegant enough for real estate transactions, yet warm and welcoming for all clients.
